Assignment - 1  Session 1 – Introduction     Problem Statement  1. Say True or False for the below statements:  • Prescriptive Analytics used to predict the future outcomes?  Ans:- TRUE • Base R packages installed automatically?   Ans:- FALSE  2. What is Recycling of elements in a vector?   Ans:- Recycling occurs when vector arithmetic is performed on multiple vectors of different sizes. R takes the shorter vector and repeats them until it becomes long enough to match the longer one.  3. Give an example of recycling of elements.   > c(1,2,3,4,5,6) + c(1,3) [1] 2 5 4 7 6 9  As you can see, the c(1,3) vector repeated itself to form c(1,3,1,3,1,3) so that it could successfully match the previous term. If the shorter vector is not a vector of the longer one, then a warning message appears, but the operation still takes place. > c(1,2,3,4,5) + c(1,3) [1] 2 5 4 7 6   Warning message: In c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) + c(1, 3) :   longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length.
